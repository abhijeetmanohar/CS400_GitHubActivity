Story setting on Mars, June 18th 7020, Martian Calendar..

Earth, a planet close to ours, was pre-occupied with species called "human beings" who are our ancestors. We, as martian beings, have evolved from human beings with a 30 times more complex body structure and roughly 20 times more brain complexity. Human beings had the ability to create interesting objects like slow-moving cars, tiny skyscrapers and much more. However, their brain was not much evolved to be fast and efficient and made frequent mistakes like causing destruction to their own species and their planet. Roughly in the year 2020, they happened to develop a virus that surprisingly could spread fast and affect the human beings. They called it a 'coronavirus'. They managed, somehow, to control the situated, and they survived! However, 60 years after that, they mistakenly developed a highly-destructive, nuclear-savvy virus.
